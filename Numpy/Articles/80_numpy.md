## Numpy - An Introduction

> **Definition**:  
> The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

### Features of Numpy
- **Powerful N-dimensional arrays** : Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.
- **Numerical computing tools** : NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.
- **Open source** : Distributed under a liberal BSD license, NumPy is developed and maintained publicly on GitHub by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse community.
- **Interoperable** : NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.
- **Performant** : The core of NumPy is well-optimized C code. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.
- **Easy to use** : NumPyâ€™s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
