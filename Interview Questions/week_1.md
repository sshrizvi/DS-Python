<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 2 : What is dynamically typed language ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
## Dynamically Typed Language

A dynamically typed language is a programming language in which the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. This means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you write the code; the interpreter figures it out based on the variable's value during execution. Python is an example of a dynamically typed language.

### Characteristics of Dynamically Typed Languages

- **Type Flexibility**: Variables can be assigned different types of values throughout their lifecycle.
- **Ease of Use**: No need to explicitly declare variable types, making code shorter and easier to write.
- **Runtime Type Errors**: Type-related errors are caught only when the specific line of code is executed, not at compile time.

### Example

```python
x = 10       # x is an integer
print(x)     # Output: 10

x = "hello"  # Now x is a string
print(x)     # Output: hello
```

In the example above, the variable `x` first holds an integer and then a string, showcasing the dynamic typing feature of Python.

## Strongly Typed vs. Weakly Typed Languages

The concepts of strongly typed and weakly typed languages refer to how strictly types are enforced in a language.

### Strongly Typed Languages

A strongly typed language is one in which the type of a variable is strictly enforced. This means that once a variable is assigned a type, it cannot be implicitly converted to another type without an explicit conversion.

- **Type Safety**: Operations between mismatched types are not allowed.
- **Explicit Type Conversions**: Required for operations involving different types.
- **Fewer Runtime Errors**: Type errors are caught early, often at compile time.

#### Example: Python

Python is both dynamically typed and strongly typed.

```python
x = "10"
y = 2
print(x + y)  # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

In Python, trying to add a string and an integer results in a `TypeError`. This shows Python's strong typing, as it does not allow implicit type conversion.

### Weakly Typed Languages

A weakly typed language is one in which the type of a variable is not strictly enforced. This means that the language allows implicit type conversions, often leading to unexpected behavior.

- **Implicit Type Conversions**: The language automatically converts types when necessary.
- **Potential Type Confusion**: May lead to subtle bugs if types are not handled carefully.

#### Example: JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamically typed and weakly typed language.

```javascript
var x = "10";
var y = 2;
console.log(x + y);  // Output: "102"
```

In JavaScript, adding a string and an integer results in string concatenation, implicitly converting the integer to a string.

## Summary

### Dynamically Typed Language

- **Definition**: Type of a variable is determined at runtime.
- **Example**: Python.

### Strongly Typed Language

- **Definition**: Type of a variable is strictly enforced; implicit conversions are not allowed.
- **Example**: Python (dynamically typed but strongly typed).

### Weakly Typed Language

- **Definition**: Type of a variable is not strictly enforced; implicit conversions are allowed.
- **Example**: JavaScript (dynamically typed but weakly typed).

Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective programming, as they influence how you write and debug your code. In dynamically typed and strongly typed languages like Python, you benefit from flexibility while maintaining type safety, which helps prevent many common programming errors.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 3 : What is an Interpreted Language ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
### What is an Interpreted Language?

An interpreted language is a type of programming language in which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without the need for prior compilation into machine-language instructions. In other words, programs written in an interpreted language are typically executed from the source code through an interpreter, which reads and executes the code line by line at runtime.

#### Characteristics of Interpreted Languages

1. **Dynamic Typing**: Many interpreted languages are dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime.
2. **Platform Independence**: Interpreted languages often offer a high degree of platform independence, as the interpreter is responsible for translating code to the machine-specific instructions.
3. **Ease of Debugging**: Interpreted languages usually provide more straightforward debugging capabilities because the interpreter can execute and test the code line by line.
4. **Slower Execution**: Since code is interpreted at runtime rather than precompiled, interpreted languages may run slower compared to compiled languages.

#### Examples of Interpreted Languages

- **Python**: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is widely used in web development, data science, and scripting.
- **JavaScript**: Primarily used for client-side web development, JavaScript runs in web browsers and enables interactive web pages.
- **Ruby**: A dynamic, reflective, object-oriented language used mainly for web applications, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework.
- **Perl**: Known for its powerful text-processing capabilities, Perl is often used for web development, system administration, and network programming.

#### How Interpreted Languages Work

When running a program written in an interpreted language:
1. **Source Code**: The source code is written in a high-level language.
2. **Interpreter**: The interpreter reads and translates the source code into intermediate code (if applicable) and then executes it line by line.
3. **Execution**: The program runs directly from the source code or intermediate code, translating instructions into machine code on the fly.

#### Benefits of Interpreted Languages

- **Portability**: Interpreted languages are usually more portable across different systems since the interpreter handles the machine-specific instructions.
- **Rapid Development**: They allow for quick testing and iteration during development, as changes can be tested immediately without recompiling.
- **Interactive Execution**: Many interpreted languages support interactive execution (e.g., REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop), which is useful for debugging and learning.

#### Drawbacks of Interpreted Languages

- **Performance**: Interpreted languages can be slower than compiled languages because the code is translated on the fly rather than being precompiled.
- **Resource Usage**: They may require more system resources due to the overhead of the interpreter.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 4 : What is PEP8 and why is it important ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
PEP 8 is the **Python Enhancement Proposal** that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It was written by Guido van Rossum and Barry Warsaw and is now maintained by the Python community.

### Key Points of PEP 8

1. **Code Layout**:
   - **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
   - **Line Length**: Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
   - **Blank Lines**: Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines, and methods within a class with one blank line.

2. **Imports**:
   - Import standard libraries first, followed by third-party libraries, and then local application-specific imports.
   - Use absolute imports rather than relative ones.

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - **Variables and Functions**: Use `lowercase_with_underscores`.
   - **Classes**: Use `CapitalizedWords` (also known as CamelCase).
   - **Constants**: Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`.

4. **Programming Recommendations**:
   - Avoid using global variables.
   - Use list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise and readable code.

5. **Comments**:
   - Write comments that are clear and helpful.
   - Use inline comments sparingly and only to explain why code is doing something, not what it is doing.

6. **Docstrings**:
   - Use triple quotes for docstrings to document modules, classes, and functions.
   - Ensure that docstrings provide a description of what the module, class, or function does.

### Importance of PEP 8

- **Consistency**: It helps maintain a uniform style across Python codebases, making it easier for developers to read and understand code written by others.
- **Readability**: Well-styled code is more readable, which reduces the likelihood of errors and makes the code easier to maintain and debug.
- **Best Practices**: PEP 8 incorporates Python‚Äôs best practices, ensuring that code is written efficiently and effectively.

Following PEP 8 is generally considered a best practice in Python development, as it promotes clean, readable, and maintainable code.

For more detailed information on PEP 8 and its guidelines, you can refer to the official documentation:

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 6 : What is operator precedence in Python ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
Operator precedence in Python determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. If two operators have the same precedence, their associativity determines the order in which they are evaluated.

Here‚Äôs a table summarizing Python‚Äôs operator precedence from highest to lowest:

| **Precedence Level** | **Operators**                               | **Associativity** |
|:----------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 1                    | `()` (Parentheses)                         | -                 |
| 2                    | `**` (Exponentiation)                      | Right-to-Left     |
| 3                    | `+x`, `-x`, `~x` (Unary Plus, Unary Minus, Bitwise NOT) | Right-to-Left     |
| 4                    | `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` (Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus) | Left-to-Right     |
| 5                    | `+`, `-` (Addition, Subtraction)           | Left-to-Right     |
| 6                    | `<<`, `>>` (Bitwise Shifts)                | Left-to-Right     |
| 7                    | `&` (Bitwise AND)                          | Left-to-Right     |
| 8                    | `^` (Bitwise XOR)                          | Left-to-Right     |
| 9                    | `|` (Bitwise OR)                           | Left-to-Right     |

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 7 : Explain Ternary Operator in Python ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
Actually, Python does have a ternary operator, but it is a bit different from the traditional ternary operator found in some other languages.

In Python, the ternary operator is implemented as a conditional expression, and it's used to select between two expressions based on a condition. While it might not use the `? :` syntax common in languages like C or Java, Python's `x if condition else y` serves the same purpose.

### Example

Here‚Äôs how it works in Python:

```python
result = "yes" if condition else "no"
```

In this expression:
- **`condition`** is evaluated.
- If **`condition`** is `True`, **`"yes"`** is assigned to **`result`**.
- If **`condition`** is `False`, **`"no"`** is assigned to **`result`**.

### Comparison

In other languages like C or Java, the ternary operator syntax is:

```c
result = condition ? "yes" : "no";
```

In Python, the equivalent is:

```python
result = "yes" if condition else "no"
```

So, while the syntax differs, Python does have a ternary operator in the form of a conditional expression.

For more information on Python's ternary operator and conditional expressions, you can refer to the official Python documentation:

- **Python Conditional Expressions**: [Python Documentation on Conditional Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions)

This page provides detailed explanations and examples of how conditional expressions (ternary operators) work in Python.

<details>
<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 8 : What does the <code>is</code> operator do ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
The `is` operator in Python is used to check if two variables reference the same object in memory. It's not concerned with the values of the objects themselves but rather with whether the two variables point to the exact same object.

### Syntax

```python
a is b
```

- **`a`** and **`b`** are variables or expressions.
- The expression returns `True` if `a` and `b` refer to the same object in memory.
- It returns `False` if `a` and `b` refer to different objects, even if their values are the same.

### Example

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a is b)  # Output: False (a and b are different objects with the same values)
print(a is c)  # Output: True (a and c refer to the same object)
```

In this example:
- **`a is b`** is `False` because `a` and `b` are two different list objects, even though they contain the same values.
- **`a is c`** is `True` because `c` is assigned the same object as `a`, so both variables refer to the same list object.

### Use Cases

- **Identity Comparison**: The `is` operator is useful when you want to check if two variables point to the same object. This is often used for singletons, such as `None`, where you want to check if a variable is exactly `None`.

```python
x = None
if x is None:
    print("x is None")
```

- **Singleton Objects**: For objects like `None`, `True`, and `False`, which are singletons in Python, `is` is used to check identity.

### Comparison with `==`

- The `==` operator checks for value equality, meaning it compares the values of the objects to see if they are equal.
- The `is` operator checks for identity, meaning it compares if two references point to the same object in memory.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

print(a == b)  # Output: True (a and b have the same values)
print(a is b)  # Output: False (a and b are different objects)
```

In summary, use `is` when you need to verify that two variables refer to the exact same object, and use `==` when you want to compare the values of objects.

> [!NOTE]  
> If different variables have same values in the range of -5 to 256. Python will refer the different variables to same memory location.  
> ```python
> a = 1
> b = 1
> print(id(a)) # 124789
> print(id(b)) # 124789
> ```
> This shows that `a` and `b` refer to same memory location. Weird! Isn't it?

For more detailed information about the `is` operator and object identity in Python, you can refer to the official Python documentation:

- **Python Documentation on Identity Operators**: [Python Reference - Identity Operators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#is)

This section of the documentation explains the `is` and `is not` operators, including their purpose and usage in Python.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 9 : What are the disadvantages of Python ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
While Python is a highly versatile and popular programming language, it does have some disadvantages and limitations that might impact its suitability for certain tasks or projects. Here are some of the common disadvantages:

### 1. **Performance Issues**
   - **Slower Execution**: Python is generally slower than compiled languages like C or C++ due to its interpreted nature. The dynamic typing and high-level nature of Python can lead to slower execution times.

### 2. **Memory Consumption**
   - **High Memory Usage**: Python can consume more memory compared to lower-level languages. This is due to its built-in features like dynamic typing and high-level data structures.

### 3. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**
   - **Concurrency Limitations**: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be a limitation for multi-threaded programs. It prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once, which can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound multi-threaded applications.

### 4. **Mobile and Web Development**
   - **Limited Use in Mobile Development**: Python is not commonly used for mobile app development compared to languages like Java, Swift, or Kotlin. While frameworks like Kivy or BeeWare exist, Python is less popular for mobile app development.
   - **Web Development**: Although Python is used in web development with frameworks like Django and Flask, it is generally less performant compared to some other languages and frameworks optimized for high-traffic applications.

### 5. **Dynamic Typing**
   - **Type-Related Errors**: Python's dynamic typing can lead to type-related runtime errors, which may only be caught during execution. This can sometimes lead to bugs that are harder to trace.

### 6. **Dependency Management**
   - **Package Management**: Managing dependencies and package versions can sometimes be challenging, particularly in complex projects with many dependencies. Although tools like `pip` and `virtualenv` help, dependency issues can still arise.

### 7. **Design and Development of Large Systems**
   - **Maintainability**: For very large systems, Python's dynamic typing and flexibility might lead to code that is harder to maintain or refactor, especially if not managed carefully.

### 8. **Tooling and Libraries**
   - **Less Specialized Libraries**: While Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries, there are some specialized libraries or tools available in other languages that might not have direct equivalents in Python.

### 9. **Runtime Errors**
   - **Errors at Runtime**: Python‚Äôs dynamic nature means that some errors, which might be caught at compile time in statically-typed languages, are only detected at runtime.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 10 : How strings are stored in Python ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
In Python, strings are stored as immutable sequences of Unicode characters. Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of how strings are managed and stored:

### 1. **Immutability**

- **Immutable Objects**: Once a string is created in Python, it cannot be changed. This means any modification to a string results in the creation of a new string object. For example, concatenating two strings creates a new string rather than altering the original strings.

### 2. **Unicode Encoding**

- **Unicode Representation**: Python strings are Unicode by default, which means they can represent a wide range of characters from various languages and symbol sets. This is crucial for handling international text.
- **Encoding**: Internally, Python uses different encoding schemes (like UTF-8) to represent these Unicode characters. The exact encoding used can vary based on the Python version and implementation.

### 3. **Internal Representation**

- **String Interning**: Python may optimize memory usage by using a technique called "interning" for some strings. String interning means that identical immutable strings might be stored only once in memory, and references to those strings will point to the same memory location. This is often used for small and frequently used strings, such as identifiers or constants.
- **Memory Storage**: The actual storage of strings involves using a data structure that includes the character data and metadata such as the length of the string.

### 4. **Memory Efficiency**

- **Compact Storage**: Python strings are typically stored in a compact, efficient format. The memory layout of a string can vary between implementations, but Python ensures that it is handled in a way that balances performance and memory usage.
- **Garbage Collection**: Python uses automatic garbage collection to manage memory, which means that unused string objects are cleaned up and freed automatically.

### 5. **String Operations**

- **Copy-On-Write**: Due to immutability, operations that modify strings (like slicing or concatenation) do not alter the original string but rather create new strings. This is managed efficiently by Python to minimize unnecessary copying.

### Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example illustrating the immutability and internal representation of strings:

```python
a = "hello"
b = "hello"

print(a is b)  # Output: True (Both variables reference the same string object)
```

In this example, the `a` and `b` variables both reference the same string object because Python‚Äôs internal string interning optimization is at work.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 11 : What is Zen of Python ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
The **Zen of Python** is a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in Python. It was authored by Tim Peters and provides a concise summary of the philosophy and design principles that guide Python's development and usage. The Zen of Python is often appreciated for its emphasis on simplicity, readability, and explicitness.

### How to Access the Zen of Python

You can view the Zen of Python directly in the Python interpreter by typing:

```python
import this
```

### Principles of the Zen of Python

Here are the key principles from the Zen of Python:

1. **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
   - Code should be aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.

2. **Explicit is better than implicit.**
   - Code should be clear and explicit in its intention.

3. **Simple is better than complex.**
   - Simple solutions are preferred over complex ones.

4. **Complex is better than complicated.**
   - If complexity is necessary, it should not be disguised as simplicity.

5. **Flat is better than nested.**
   - Avoid deep nesting of structures; aim for a flat and readable design.

6. **Sparse is better than dense.**
   - Code should be spaced out to enhance readability, rather than being tightly packed.

7. **Readability counts.**
   - Code should be easy to read and understand by others.

8. **Special cases aren‚Äôt special enough to break the rules.**
   - Follow the established principles even when dealing with special cases.

9. **Although practicality beats purity.**
   - Practical solutions are valued over strictly adhering to ideal principles.

10. **Errors should never pass silently.**
    - Errors should be visible and handled, not ignored.

11. **Unless explicitly silenced.**
    - If errors are to be ignored, it should be done explicitly.

12. **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.**
    - Avoid making assumptions when the intent is unclear.

13. **There should be one‚Äîand preferably only one‚Äîobvious way to do it.**
    - There should be a clear and single approach to achieve a task.

14. **Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you‚Äôre Dutch.**
    - Sometimes, the best way to do things may not be immediately apparent to everyone.

15. **Now is better than never.**
    - It is better to act now than to delay indefinitely.

16. **Although never is often better than right now.**
    - Rushing into things is not always the best approach.

17. **If the implementation is hard to explain, it‚Äôs a bad idea.**
    - Code should be easy to explain; if not, consider redesigning it.

18. **If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.**
    - Simple and understandable implementations are preferred.

19. **Namespaces are one honking great idea‚Äîlet‚Äôs do more of those!**
    - Proper use of namespaces is encouraged for organizing code effectively.

These principles help guide Python developers in writing code that is clean, maintainable, and aligned with the core philosophy of the language.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 12 : What does <code>_</code> variable means in Python ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
In Python, the underscore `_` is a versatile and context-dependent variable that can have different meanings depending on where and how it is used. Here are some of the common uses of the underscore:

### 1. **Ignoring Values**

- **Unused Variables**: The underscore is often used as a placeholder for variables whose values are not needed. For example, when unpacking tuples or lists where only some values are required, you can use `_` to ignore the others.

  ```python
  x, _, z = (1, 2, 3)
  # Here, `_` is used to ignore the second value (2)
  ```

### 2. **Loop Iterations**

- **Throwaway Variables**: In loops where the loop variable is not used, `_` can be used as a convention to indicate that the variable is intentionally unused.

  ```python
  for _ in range(5):
      print("Hello")
  ```

### 3. **Interactive Interpreter**

- **Last Expression Result**: In the Python interactive shell (REPL), `_` holds the result of the last executed expression.

  ```python
  >>> 2 + 3
  5
  >>> _
  5
  ```

### 4. **Translation Functions**

- **Internationalization**: In some frameworks and libraries, `_` is used as an alias for translation functions to mark strings for localization.

  ```python
  from gettext import gettext as _
  
  print(_("Welcome to the application"))
  ```

### 5. **Single Underscore Prefix**

- **Name Mangling**: A single underscore prefix (e.g., `_var`) is used to indicate that a variable or method is intended for internal use. It is a convention rather than a strict access control mechanism.

  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def __init__(self):
          self._internal_var = 42
  ```

### 6. **Single Underscore Suffix**

- **Avoiding Conflicts**: A single underscore suffix (e.g., `var_`) is used to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords or built-in names.

  ```python
  class_ = "Python"  # `class` is a reserved keyword
  ```

### 7. **Double Underscore Prefix and Suffix**

- **Dunder Methods**: Double underscores before and after a name (e.g., `__init__`) are used for special methods or attributes in Python (also known as "dunder" methods).

  ```python
  class MyClass:
      def __init__(self):
          self.value = 0
      def __str__(self):
          return str(self.value)
  ```

In summary, `_` is a flexible tool in Python that serves various purposes depending on the context. Its most common use is to indicate that a value is intentionally unused, but it can also play a role in other conventions and functionalities within the language.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 13 : Differentiate module v/s packages v/s library.</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
In Python, **modules**, **packages**, and **libraries** are related but distinct concepts used for organizing and managing code. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each term:

### 1. **Module**

- **Definition**: A module is a single file containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables and can include runnable code.
- **Purpose**: Modules are used to organize related functions and classes into a single file, making it easier to manage and reuse code.
- **Usage**: Modules are imported using the `import` statement.

  ```python
  # Example of a module named `math_utils.py`
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y

  def subtract(x, y):
      return x - y

  # Importing the module
  import math_utils
  result = math_utils.add(5, 3)
  ```

### 2. **Package**

- **Definition**: A package is a directory containing multiple Python modules and an `__init__.py` file. It can also contain sub-packages, which are packages within packages.
- **Purpose**: Packages help in organizing modules into a hierarchy of directories, making it easier to manage large codebases by grouping related modules together.
- **Structure**: A package directory must include an `__init__.py` file, which can be empty or include initialization code for the package.

  ```
  mypackage/
      __init__.py
      module1.py
      module2.py
      subpackage/
          __init__.py
          module3.py
  ```

  ```python
  # Importing from a package
  from mypackage import module1
  from mypackage.subpackage import module3
  ```

### 3. **Library**

- **Definition**: A library is a collection of modules and packages that provide functionalities and tools for specific tasks or domains. Libraries are broader than individual modules or packages.
- **Purpose**: Libraries offer reusable code for various functionalities, such as data manipulation, web development, or scientific computing. They are often distributed as third-party packages and can be installed using package managers like `pip`.
- **Examples**: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Requests`, `Django`.

  ```python
  # Example of using a library
  import numpy as np
  array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  ```

### Summary

- **Module**: A single file containing Python code. Used for organizing related code.
- **Package**: A directory containing multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file. Used for organizing modules into a hierarchical structure.
- **Library**: A collection of modules and packages that provide specific functionalities. Often installed and managed via package managers.

Understanding these concepts helps in organizing code effectively, reusing existing code, and managing dependencies in Python projects.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 14 : Why 0.3 - 0.2 not equal to 0.1 in Python ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
In Python, the expression `0.3 - 0.2` does not exactly equal `0.1` due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in computers. This issue arises from the limitations of floating-point arithmetic and how decimal numbers are approximated in binary.

### Floating-Point Representation

- **Binary Approximation**: Floating-point numbers are stored in a binary format (IEEE 754 standard) which can only approximate most decimal fractions. For instance, `0.1` cannot be precisely represented in binary, so it is approximated.

- **Precision**: This approximation can lead to small errors in calculations involving floating-point numbers. When performing arithmetic operations, these small errors can accumulate, leading to unexpected results.

### Example

In Python, the following expression:

```python
0.3 - 0.2
```

might not exactly equal `0.1` due to these precision issues. To demonstrate this:

```python
result = 0.3 - 0.2
print(result)        # Output: 0.09999999999999998
print(result == 0.1) # Output: False
```

Here, `0.3 - 0.2` yields a result that is very close to `0.1`, but not exactly equal due to the precision limits of floating-point arithmetic.

### Solution: Tolerance

To handle such precision issues, you can use a tolerance when comparing floating-point numbers. This involves checking if the difference between the numbers is within a small threshold:

```python
tolerance = 1e-10
result = 0.3 - 0.2
print(abs(result - 0.1) < tolerance)  # Output: True
```

- **IEEE 754 Standard**: [IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)

Understanding these limitations helps in designing and debugging numerical calculations involving floating-point numbers.

<summary>  ‚ùì <i>Question 15 : What are Python Docstrings ?</i> </summary>

***Answer :*** 
Python **docstrings** (documentation strings) are a way to document code in Python. They are string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module. Docstrings are used to describe what the function, method, class, or module does, and they can be accessed programmatically.

### Key Features of Docstrings

1. **Documentation**:
   - Docstrings provide a convenient way to document the purpose and usage of code components directly within the code itself.

2. **Access**:
   - Docstrings can be accessed via the `.__doc__` attribute of the object they document. This makes it easy to retrieve documentation programmatically.

3. **Format**:
   - Docstrings are written using triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`) and can be multi-line, allowing for detailed explanations.

### Syntax

- **Function Docstring**:

  ```python
  def my_function(param1, param2):
      """
      This is the docstring for the function.

      Parameters:
      param1 (type): Description of param1
      param2 (type): Description of param2

      Returns:
      type: Description of return value
      """
      pass
  ```

- **Class Docstring**:

  ```python
  class MyClass:
      """
      This is the docstring for the class.

      Attributes:
      attribute1 (type): Description of attribute1
      attribute2 (type): Description of attribute2
      """

      def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):
          self.attribute1 = attribute1
          self.attribute2 = attribute2

      def my_method(self):
          """
          This is the docstring for a method.

          Returns:
          type: Description of return value
          """
          pass
  ```

- **Module Docstring**:

  ```python
  """
  This is the docstring for the module.

  This module provides functionalities for XYZ.

  Functions:
  - function1: Description of function1
  - function2: Description of function2
  """
  ```

### Usage

- **Documentation Generation**: Tools like Sphinx use docstrings to generate documentation automatically.
- **Interactive Help**: The `help()` function and interactive environments like IPython can display docstrings, providing users with information about functions, classes, and modules.

  ```python
  help(my_function)  # Displays the docstring for `my_function`
  ```

### Best Practices

- **Be Descriptive**: Provide a clear and concise description of what the code does, its parameters, and its return values.
- **Use Consistent Formatting**: Follow a consistent style and format for docstrings to improve readability and maintainability.

### References
